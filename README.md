R code associated w/ Cullen et al. paper on the development of a transferable species distribution model (SDM) framework that includes both mechanistic and correlative processes. This modeling approach is demonstrated using green turtles (*Chelonia mydas*) tracked in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as along the coasts of Brazil and Qatar. A brief summary of the project and results can be found [here](https://joshcullen.github.io/Research/GreenTurtleSDM.html). 

This repository stores the R scripts used to process and analyze data, visualize the results, and generate figures. Data (green turtle tracks and environmental raster layers) are also archived in this repo, as well as on Zenodo.
